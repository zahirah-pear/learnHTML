Hello, it's RAYE here
Please, get nice and comfortable and lock your phones
Because the story is about to begin (uh)

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna tell you 'bout
One of the many men, name is irrelevant, height is irrelevant
He was a one out of a ten, I wish that I knew it then
I'm still recovering

Truly, I'm vulnerable, I love a sentiment
Quickly I opened up, I learned my lesson then
Thought I was safe again, thought he was innocent
I was so wrong

I can't deny
I was stuck in the daze, terrible phase
You was convincing, though
Very believable, the role that you played

So, I'll take this front row seat
And baby, baby, you can go ahead
Cry those Oscar-winning tears
Popcorn and ice cream
Baby, baby, you can go ahead
Cry those Oscar-winning tears, baby, hmm

Oh, what a tragedy, it didn't have to be
Look how you talk to me, cursing and blasphemy
Cinematography, get this on camera, please
Or no one gon' believe this here

I can't deny
I thought you were the man, but you had a plan
The fuck you lying for? Fuck you crying for?
You did it again (yeah, ah-ah-ah)

So, I'll take this front row seat
And baby, baby, you can go ahead
Cry those Oscar-winning tears
Popcorn and ice cream
Baby, baby, you can go ahead
Cry those Oscar-winning (tears) tears, baby

You can miss me with the bullshit
I can see right through your (tears) tears, baby
Nine o'clock entertainment
Oh, man, I wish I could tape it

Sit down, no tissues
No string section, no tiny violin
For the last time, I'm your audience

I'll take this front row seat
And baby, baby, you can go ahead and cry those, baby
And baby, baby, baby, would you really go ahead
And would you go ahead and just cry, cry, cry? (Tears, baby)
C-cry those Oscar (Oscar) winning (winning) tears (tears), baby
(Tears, baby, go ahead, cry those Oscar-winning)

And after his Oscar-winning performance
I left the room and never saw him again
