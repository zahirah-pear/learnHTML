- `README.md` - Instructions and learning objectives
- `exercise.html` - Starter code with TODOs
- `solution.html` - Complete working solution

### Day 2 & 3

Each exercise is a Vite project with:

- `exercises/<name>/src/App.jsx` - Main component to edit
- `solutions/<name>/src/App.jsx` - Complete working solution
- `README.md` - Instructions per exercise
- Run with `npm run dev:01`, `npm run solution:01`, etc.

## Curriculum

### Day 1: From DOM to React

**[📁 Day 1 Exercises](./day-1/)**

#### 1. Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-1/01-dom-hello-world/)**

- Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Creating DOM elements with vanilla JavaScript
- Using `document.createElement()` and `appendChild()`
- Adding text content and attributes
- **Exercise:** Build a "Hello World" page using only JavaScript

#### 2. Intro to React with `React.createElement()`

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-1/02-react-createElement/)**

- Why React? The declarative approach
- Setting up React via CDN (keep it simple for learning)
- Understanding `React.createElement(type, props, children)`
- Creating elements programmatically
- Rendering with `ReactDOM.createRoot()` and `root.render()`
- **Exercise:** Recreate the Hello World using `React.createElement()`

#### 3. JSX - JavaScript XML

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-1/03-jsx/)**

- What is JSX and why use it?
- JSX syntax rules (className, camelCase, self-closing tags)
- Expressions in JSX with curly braces `{}`
- Setting up Babel for JSX transformation (via CDN)
- JSX vs `React.createElement()` - understanding the compilation
- **Exercise:** Convert createElement examples to JSX

#### 4. Creating Custom Components

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-1/04-custom-components/)**

- Function components
- Component naming conventions (PascalCase)
- Composing components
- **Exercise:** Create a `Greeting` component

### Day 2: Interactive React

**[📁 Day 2 Exercises](./day-2/)**

> **Note:** Day 2 uses a modern React setup with Vite instead of HTML files. See [Day 2 README](./day-2/README.md) for setup instructions.

**Setup:**

```bash
cd day-2
npm install
```

#### 1. Props - Passing Data to Components

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-2/exercises/01-props/)** | `npm run dev:01`

- Understanding props (properties)
- Passing data from parent to child
- Destructuring props for cleaner code
- Default props
- **Exercise:** Create a `HeroCard` component that displays hero information

#### 2. Rendering Lists

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-2/exercises/02-lists/)** | `npm run dev:02`

- Using `map()` to render arrays
- The importance of `key` prop
- Filtering and transforming data
- Working with arrays in React
- **Exercise:** Display a list of heroes using the `HeroCard` component

#### 3. Handling Events

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-2/exercises/03-events/)** | `npm run dev:03`

- Event handling in React (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- Synthetic events
- Event handler functions
- Passing arguments to event handlers
- **Exercise:** Add click handlers to toggle hero details

#### 4. State with `useState`

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-2/exercises/04-state/)** | `npm run dev:04`

- What is state?
- The `useState` hook
- State vs Props
- Updating state immutably
- Managing multiple state variables
- **Exercise:** Add favorite functionality - users can mark heroes as favorites

---

### Day 3: Side Effects and Real-World App

**[📁 Day 3 Exercises](./day-3/)**

> **Note:** Day 3 uses a modern React setup with Vite instead of HTML files. See [Day 3 README](./day-3/README.md) for setup instructions.

**Setup:**

```bash
cd day-3
npm install
```

#### 1. Side Effects with `useEffect`

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-3/exercises/01-useEffect/)** | `npm run dev:01`

- What are side effects?
- The `useEffect` hook
- Dependency arrays
- Cleanup functions
- Common use cases (timers, subscriptions, etc.)
- **Exercise:** Create a timer and update document title based on state

#### 2. Data Fetching

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-3/exercises/02-data-fetching/)** | `npm run dev:02`

- Fetching data with `fetch()`
- Async/await in React
- Loading states
- Error handling
- **Exercise:** Fetch products from DummyJSON API

#### 3. Final Project - Product Showcase

**[📂 Exercise Folder](./day-3/exercises/03-final-project/)** | `npm run dev:03`

Build a complete mini web app that combines everything learned:

- Component composition (Header, ProductCard, SearchBar)
- State management (products, cart, search, filters)
- Event handling (add to cart, search, filter)
- Side effects (data fetching with useEffect)
